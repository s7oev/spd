; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a BST and produces the sum of all
; the keys in the BST.
; 


;; Data definitions:

(define-struct node (key val l r))
;; A BST (Binary Search Tree) is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - (make-node Integer String BST BST)
;; interp. false means no BST, or empty BST
;;         key is the node key
;;         val is the node val
;;         l and r are left and right subtrees
;; INVARIANT: for a given node:
;;     key is > all keys in its l(eft)  child
;;     key is < all keys in its r(ight) child
;;     the same key never appears twice in the tree
