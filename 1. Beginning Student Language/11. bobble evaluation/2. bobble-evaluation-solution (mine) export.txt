; PROBLEM:
; 
; Given the following function definition:
; 
; (define (bobble s)
;   (if (<= (string-length s) 6)
;       (string-append s "ible")
;       s))
; 
; Write out the step-by-step evaluation of the expression:
; 
; (bobble (substring "fungus" 0 4))
; 
; Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step (including the original expression
; and the final result, our answer has 7 steps).


(define (bobble s)
  (if (<= (string-length s) 6)
      (string-append s "ible")
      s))

;; step 1
(bobble (substring "fungus" 0 4))

;; step 2
(bobble "fung")

;; step 3
(if (<= (string-length "fung") 6)
    (string-append "fung" "ible")
    "fung")

;; step 4
(if (<= 4 6)
    (string-append "fung" "ible")
    "fung")

;; step 5
(if true
    (string-append "fung" "ible")
    "fung")

;; step 6
(string-append "fung" "ible")

;; step 7
"fungible"
