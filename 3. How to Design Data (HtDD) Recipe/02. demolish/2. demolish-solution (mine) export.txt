;; =================
;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; You are assigned to develop a system that will classify 
; buildings in downtown Vancouver based on how old they are. 
; According to city guidelines, there are three different classification levels:
; new, old, and heritage.
; 
; Design a data definition to represent these classification levels. 
; Call it BuildingStatus.
; 


;; BuildingStatus is one of:
;;  - "new"
;;  - "old"
;;  - "heritage"
;; interp. classify buildings in downtown Vancouver based on their age

;; <examples are redundant for enumerations>

#;
(define (fn-for-building-status s)
  (cond [(string=? s "new") (...)]
        [(string=? s "old") (...)]
        [(string=? s "heritage") (...)]))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 3 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: "new"
;;  - atomic distinct: "old"
;;  - atomic distinct: "heritage"


;; =================
;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM B:
; 
; The city wants to demolish all buildings classified as "old". 
; You are hired to design a function called demolish? 
; that determines whether a building should be torn down or not.
; 


;; Signature: BuildingStatus -> Boolean
;; Purpose: return true if building should be demolished (= building is "old")

;; Stub:
;(define (demolish? s) false)

;; Tests and Examples:
(check-expect (demolish? "new") false)
(check-expect (demolish? "old") true)
(check-expect (demolish? "heritage") false)

;; Template:
;; <template from BuildingStatus>

#;
(define (demolish? s)
  (cond [(string=? s "new") (...)]
        [(string=? s "old") (...)]
        [(string=? s "heritage") (...)]))

;; Body:
(define (demolish? s)
  (cond [(string=? s "new") false]
        [(string=? s "old") true]
        [(string=? s "heritage") false]))
