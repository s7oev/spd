; PROBLEM:
; 
; You're working with a revised version of the LetterGrade data definition that
; you saw in lecture to design a function that produces true if a given LetterGrade 
; represents a passing grade in a course. You're working through HtDF and have 
; completed the signature, purpose, stub and examples, but you're getting an 
; error message.  Uncomment the code in the box below and revise it until 
; all the tests run (even though several tests still fail).


;; LetterGrade is one of: 
;;  - "A"
;;  - "B"
;;  - "C"
;;  - "D"
;;  - "F"
;; interp. a grade in a course
;; <examples are redundant for enumerations>

(define (fn-for-letter-grade lg)
  (cond [(string=? "A" lg) (...)]
        [(string=? "B" lg) (...)]
        [(string=? "C" lg) (...)]
        [(string=? "D" lg) (...)]
        [(string=? "F" lg) (...)]))

;; LetterGrade -> Boolean
;; produce true if the LetterGrade represents a passing grade
(check-expect (pass? "A") true)
(check-expect (pass? "B") true)
(check-expect (pass? "C") true)
(check-expect (pass? "D") true)
(check-expect (pass? "F") false)

(define (pass? lg) true)
