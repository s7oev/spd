;; Data definitions:

; 
; Remember the data definition for a list of strings we designed in Lecture 5c:
; (if this data definition does not look familiar, please review the lecture)
; 


;; ListOfString is one of: 
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons String ListOfString)
;; interp. a list of strings

(define LS0 empty) 
(define LS1 (cons "a" empty))
(define LS2 (cons "a" (cons "b" empty)))
(define LS3 (cons "c" (cons "b" (cons "a" empty))))

;; Template rules used: 
;; - one of: 2 cases
;; - atomic distinct: empty
;; - compound: (cons String ListOfString)
;; - atomic non-distinct: (first los) is  String
;; - self-reference: (rest los) is ListOfString

;; =================
;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a list of strings and determines the total 
; number of characters (single letters) in the list. Call it total-string-length. 
; 


;; ListOfString -> Integer
;; Produce total number of characters in a given ListOfString
(check-expect (total-string-length empty) 0)
(check-expect (total-string-length (cons "a" empty)) (string-length "a"))

(check-expect (total-string-length (cons "abc" (cons "a" empty)))
              (+ (string-length "abc") (string-length "a")))
