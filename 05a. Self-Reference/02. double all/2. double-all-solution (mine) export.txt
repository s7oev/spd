;; Data definitions:

; 
; Remember the data definition for a list of numbers we designed in Lecture 5f:
; (if this data definition does not look familiar, please review the lecture)
; 


;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. a list of numbers

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: empty
;;  - compound: (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;;  - self-reference: (rest lon) is ListOfNumber

; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a list of numbers and doubles every number 
; in the list. Call it double-all.
; 


;; ListOfNumber -> ListOfNumber
;; Double every number in the list
