; Remember the data definition for a list of numbers we designed in Lecture 5f:
; (if this data definition does not look familiar, please review the lecture)
; 


;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. a list of numbers

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases

;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a list of numbers and produces the largest number 
; in the list. You may assume that all numbers in the list are greater than 0. If
; the list is empty, produce 0.
; 


;; ListOfNumber -> Number
;; Produce the largest number in the list
(check-expect (largest empty) 0)
(check-expect (largest (cons 10 empty)) 10)
(check-expect (largest LON2) 60)
(check-expect (largest (cons 60 (cons 77 empty))) 77)

;(define (largest lon) 0)  ;stub

;<template from ListOfNumber>
(define (largest lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (if (> (first lon) (largest (rest lon)))
             (first lon)
             (largest (rest lon)))]))
