; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a string, and adds "?" 
; to the end unless the string already ends in "?".
; 
; For this question, assume the string has length > 0. Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented 
; out versions of the stub and template.
; 


;; Signature: String -> String
;; Purpose: Given a string, append "?" to its end or do nothing if string already ends in "?"

;(define (ensure-question s) "?")

(check-expect
 (ensure-question "how are you")
 "how are you?")

(check-expect
 (ensure-question "who are you?")
 "who are you?")

;(define (ensure-question s)
;  (... s))

(define (ensure-question s)
  (if (string=?
       (string-ith s
        (- (string-length s) 1)) ;get last char
       "?")
      s
      (string-append s "?")))
