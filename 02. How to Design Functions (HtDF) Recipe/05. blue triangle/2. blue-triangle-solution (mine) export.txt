;; blue-triangle-starter.rkt

; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design a function that consumes a number and produces a blue solid triangle of that size.
; 
; You should use The How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe, and your complete design should include
; signature, purpose, commented out stub, examples/tests, commented out template and the completed function.


;; Signature: Integer -> Image ;; correction: Natural -> Image
;; Purpose: produce a blue solid triangle using given size (in pixels)

;; Stub:
;(define (blue-triangle size) (triangle 5 "solid" "blue"))

;; Tests and examples:
(check-expect (blue-triangle 10) (triangle 10 "solid" "blue"))
(check-expect (blue-triangle 20) (triangle 20 "solid" "blue"))

;; Template
;(define (blue-triangle size)
;  (... size))

;; Body
(define (blue-triangle size)
  (triangle size "solid" "blue"))
