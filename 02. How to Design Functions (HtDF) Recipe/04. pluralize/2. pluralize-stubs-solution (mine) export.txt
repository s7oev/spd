; PROBLEM:
;  
; You are working on designing a function and have completed your signature and purpose. 
; 
; Write three stubs with different bodies that are consistent with the signature and purpose below.
; Put the three stubs in a comment box.
; 
; ;; String -> String
; ;; pluralizes str by appending "s" to the end 
; 


;; Original answer:
; ;; Stub 1:
; (define (pluralize s) "")
; 
; ;; Stub 2:
; (define (plur s) "")
; 
; ;; Stub 3:
; (define (plur str) "")


;; After looking at the answers and realizing what is expected:
; ;; Stub 1:
; (define (pluralize s) "")
; 
; ;; Stub 2:
; (define (pluralize s) "foo")
; 
; ;; Stub 3:
; (define (pluralize s) s)
