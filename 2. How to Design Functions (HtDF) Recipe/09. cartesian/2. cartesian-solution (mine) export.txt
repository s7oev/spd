; PROBLEM:
; 
; In interactive games it is often useful to be able to determine the distance between two points on 
; the screen. We can describe those points using Cartesian coordinates as four numbers: x1, y1 and x2, y2. 
; The formula for the distance between those points is:
; .
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function called distance that consumes 
; four numbers representing two points and produces the distance between the two points.
; 
; Use (distance 3 0 0 4), which should produce 5 as your first example/test. Once your function works with 
; that test, try (distance 1 0 0 1) which should produce (sqrt 2). Read the error message carefully and use 
; the help desk to figure out how to use check-within for this case.
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
; 
; NOTE:
; 
; The signature for such a function is:
; 
; ;; Number Number Number Number -> Number
; 
; The template for such a function is:
; 
; ; (define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
; ;   (... x1 y1 x2 y2))


;; Signature: Number Number Number Number -> Number
;; Purpose: calculate distance between two points using their Cartesian coordinates

;; Stub:
;(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2) 0)

;; Tests and Examples:
(check-expect (distance 3 0 0 4) 5)
(check-within (distance 1 0 0 1) (sqrt 2) 0.0001)

;; Template:
;(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
;  (... x1 y1 x2 y2))

;; Body:
(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
  (sqrt(+ (sqr (- x2 x1)) (sqr (- y2 y1)))))
