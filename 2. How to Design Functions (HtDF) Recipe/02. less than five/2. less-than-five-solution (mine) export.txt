; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN function that consumes a string and determines whether its length is
; less than 5.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions 
; of the stub and template.
; 


;; Signature: String -> Boolean
;; Purpose: consume a string and return true if its length < 5 and false otherwise

;; Stub:
;(define (<five? s) false)

;; Tests and examples:
(check-expect (<five? "") true)
(check-expect (<five? "yes") true)
(check-expect (<five? "nooope") false)
(check-expect (<five? "12345") false)

;; Template:
;(define (<five? s)
;  (... s))

;; Body:
(define (<five? s)
  (< (string-length s) 5))
