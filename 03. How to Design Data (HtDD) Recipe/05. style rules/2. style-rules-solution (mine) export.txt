; PROBLEM:
; 
; You're redesigning the SeatNum data definition from lecture, and you're not
; sure if you've done it correctly. When you ask a TA for feedback, she tells
; you that you haven't followed our style rules and she asks you to re-format 
; your data definition before she gives you feedback.
; 
; a) Why is it important to follow style rules?
; 
; Answer:
; Because even though we know what we mean when we write the code initially, even-
; tually we will forget. The style rules allow us to remember just with a quick
; glance. Additionally, they give us many elements which are reusable, most notab-
; ly the template, which we can simply copy paste, and this saves us an enormous
; amount of effort. Lastly, it greatly improves readability.
; 
; b) Fix the data definition below so that it follows our style rules. Be sure to 
; consult the style rules page so that you make ALL the required changes, of which 
; there are quite a number.


;; SeatNum is Natural[1, 32]
;; interp. the seat number within a row, where seats 1 and 32 are on the aisle

(define SN1 1)   ; aisle
(define SN2 17)  ; middle
(define SN3 32)  ; aisle

#;
(define (fn-for-seatnum sn)
  (... sn))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - atomic non-distinct: Natural[1, 32]

; 
; ORIGINAL UNSTYLED CODE:
; ;seatnum is a natural[1,32]
; ;interp. The number of a seat in a row.
; ;Seats 1 and 32 are aisle seats.
; (define sn1 1)
; (define sn2 32)
; #;
; (define (fn-sn x)
;   (... x)) 
; ;; template rules used: natural[1,32]
