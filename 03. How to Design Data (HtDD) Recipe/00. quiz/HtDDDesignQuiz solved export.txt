; Problem 1:
; 
; Consider the above data definition for the age of a person.
; 
; Design a function called teenager? that determines whether a person
; of a particular age is a teenager (i.e., between the ages of 13 and 19).


;; Age -> Boolean
;; produce true if given age is in the range [13, 19], otherwise false
(check-expect (teenager? 10) false)

; Problem 2:
; 
; Design a data definition called MonthAge to represent a person's age
; in months.


;; MonthAge is Natural
;; interp. the age of a person in months
(define MA0 120)

; Problem 3:
; 
; Design a function called months-old that takes a person's age in years 
; and yields that person's age in months.
; 


;; Age -> MonthAge
;; produce person's age in months from age in years
(check-expect (months-old 10) 120)

; Problem 4:
; 
; Consider a video game where you need to represent the health of your
; character. The only thing that matters about their health is:
; 
;   - if they are dead (which is shockingly poor health)
;   - if they are alive then they can have 0 or more extra lives
; 
; Design a data definition called Health to represent the health of your
; character.
; 
; Design a function called increase-health that allows you to increase the
; lives of a character.  The function should only increase the lives
; of the character if the character is not dead, otherwise the character
; remains dead.


;; Health is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - Natural
;; interp. false means dead, natural is number of lives left and thus
;; implies alive

(define H2 0)
