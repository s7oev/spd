; PROBLEM:
; 
; Based on the two constants provided, write three expressions to determine whether: 
; 
; 1) IMAGE1 is taller than IMAGE2
; 2) IMAGE1 is narrower than IMAGE2
; 3) IMAGE1 has both the same width AND height as IMAGE2
; 


(define IMAGE1 (rectangle 10 15 "solid" "red"))
(define IMAGE2 (rectangle 15 10 "solid" "red"))

IMAGE1
IMAGE2

(> (image-height IMAGE1) (image-height IMAGE2))

(< (image-width IMAGE1)  (image-width IMAGE2))

(and (= (image-width IMAGE1) (image-width IMAGE2))
     (= (image-height IMAGE1) (image-height IMAGE2)))
